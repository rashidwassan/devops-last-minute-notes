# General DevOps Concepts

## Core Principles and Practices

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
- A development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, ideally several times a day.

### 2. Continuous Delivery (CD)
- A software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production.

### 3. Continuous Deployment
- An extension of continuous delivery, where every change that passes all stages of the production pipeline is released to customers automatically without explicit approval.

### 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- The management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code.

### 5. Configuration Management
- The process of standardizing resource configurations and enforcing their state across IT infrastructure in an automated yet secure manner.

### 6. Monitoring and Logging
- Tracking the performance of applications and infrastructure to ensure expected levels of service through the collection of logs and monitoring data.

### 7. Microservices Architecture
- A design approach to build a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms.

### 8. Containerization
- An OS-level virtualization method used to deploy and run distributed applications without launching an entire virtual machine for each app.

### 9. Orchestration
- The automated management of computer systems, middleware, and services, often involving automated workflows and service coordination.

### 10. DevSecOps
- Integrating security practices within the DevOps process. DevSecOps involves creating a 'Security as Code' culture with ongoing, flexible collaboration between release engineers and security teams.

## Tools and Technologies

### 11. Docker
- An open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside software containers.

### 12. Kubernetes
- An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### 13. Ansible
- An open-source automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and also IT orchestration.

### 14. Terraform
- An open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services.

### 15. Jenkins
- An open-source automation server used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.

### 16. Prometheus
- An open-source system monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud.

### 17. Grafana
- An open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored.

### 18. Git
- A free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### 19. GitLab
- A web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git repository manager providing wiki, issue-tracking, and CI/CD pipeline features.

### 20. ELK Stack
- The Elastic Stack (formerly known as the ELK Stack) is the combination of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for logging, storing, searching, and managing logs.

## Methodologies

### 21. Agile Development
- An approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams.

### 22. Lean Manufacturing
- A methodology that focuses on minimizing waste within manufacturing systems while simultaneously maximizing productivity.

### 23. Kanban
- A visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. Kanban visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing through that process.

### 24. Scrum
- A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

## Key Concepts

### 25. Version Control
- A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

### 26. Artifact Repository
- A repository for managing binary components, which is essential in the build process for storing and supplying artifacts.

### 27. Service Mesh
- A dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication in microservices architectures, often using a sidecar proxy.

### 28. Observability
- The ability to measure the internal states of a system by examining its outputs. It is crucial for modern architectures since it provides insights into system performance and health.

### 29. Cloud Computing
- Internet-based computing that provides shared processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand.

### 30. High Availability
- A characteristic of a system which aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime,
