# DevOps Last Minute Notes

Welcome to the DevOps Last Minute Notes repository! This guide is designed to provide a clear roadmap for learning DevOps, offering a structured approach to mastering fundamental concepts and advanced topics alike. Whether you're preparing for interviews, tests, or just looking to refresh your knowledge, these notes are here to help you avoid the embarrassment of forgetting the simple things you once knew.

## Roadmap
To make learning DevOps easy, we will follow a proper logical order in which you will potentially be working in a formal environment.
Follow this roadmap to navigate through the concepts in a logical order:

### Basics

1. **Linux - Zero to Hero**  
   Linux is a very powerful platform that powers a lot of free and powerful operating systems used in a large number of organizations in their development and production environments        worldwide. Getting started with Linux will help us in learning upcoming topics, computer networking, and virtualization. Get yourself familiar with the basics of Linux at your own        pace then move to computer networking so that familiarity with Linux can help you in doing fun experiments to learn computer networking practically.

2. **Computer Networking**  
   **Building it from scratch:** Getting to know the infrastructure you will be working with, is one of the initial steps to get started. To form our foundations to get ready for            understanding on-prem and cloud settings, familiarity with computer networking concepts is a must. Refer to the notes attached, feel free to explore these concepts on your own, use 
   these notes as a glossary and a torchlight to discover different terminologies in the Computer Networking domain so that you do not miss out on the important concepts.
   > Tip: set up a Linux machine and try working with these concepts.

3. **Virtualization**  
   Virtualization is at the core of modern systems, similarly, in DevOps. After getting familiar with computer networking concepts, virtualization is the domain to explore as it powers      almost all the on-prem and cloud setups. This will be our second step towards getting DevOps ready and will pave the way for you to jump into the domain of cloud computing.
   A clear understanding of virtualization will help you understand a lot of DevOps concepts.

4. **Linux Commands**  
   Now that you are already familiar with all the necessary concepts to level up, let's get to the next level and practice some important Linux commands to make your life as a DevOps        Engineer easy. This collection the commands is like your multi-purpose toolbox to become a Linux power user. Get familiar with common Linux commands that you'll use daily in DevOps        roles.  
   [**Read Linux Commands**](linux-commands.md)

5. **Git**  
   Git is at the core of every organization, regardless of the hosting platform (GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket), git is used almost everywhere. To understand Continuous Integration, strong understanding of Git is essential.

### Core DevOps Tools

6. **Jenkins**  
   Now you have an understanding and hands-on with Git, what next? How to propagate your deployment after pushing changes?
   Learn about Jenkins, a continuous integration/continuous deployment tool that automates various stages of your projects.  
   [Read Jenkins](jenkins.md)

8. **Docker**  
   Dive into Docker, a cornerstone for managing containers that encapsulate application environments.  
   [**Read Docker**](docker.md)

9. **Kubernetes**  
   Explore Kubernetes, the container orchestration tool that manages clusters of containers at scale.  
   [**Read Kubernetes**](kubernetes.md)

### Advanced Concepts

9. **DevOps Concepts**  
   Broaden your understanding with advanced DevOps concepts that tie all the tools and practices together.
