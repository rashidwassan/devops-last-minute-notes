    - The arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a communication network.

### 16. **`Ethernet`**
    - A family of computer networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LAN), metropolitan area networks (MAN) and wide area networks (WAN).

### 19. **`HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)`**
    - An application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.

### 20. **`HTTPS (HTTP Secure)`**
    - An extension of HTTP used for secure communication over a computer network, and widely used on the Internet.

### 21. **`MAC Address (Media Access Control Address)`**
    - A unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.

### 22. **`Packet`**
    - A small segment of data sent over a network that contains information necessary to route and deliver the data to the correct destination.

### 23. **`Bandwidth`**
    - The maximum rate of data transfer across a given path.

### 24. **`Latency`**
    - The delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer.

### 25. **`Network Protocol`**
    - A set of rules and conventions for communication between network devices.

### 26. **`ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)`**
    - Used by network devices, like routers, to send error messages and operational information.

### 27. **`SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)`**
    - An Internet Standard protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior.

### 28. **`QoS (Quality of Service)`**
    - The description or measurement of the overall performance of a service, such as a telephony or computer network or a cloud computing service.

### 29. **`Collision Domain`**
    - A network segment where data packets can "collide" with one another when being sent on a shared medium, particularly in Ethernet networks.

### 30. **`Broadcast Domain`**
    - A logical division of a computer network, in which all nodes can reach each other by broadcast at the data link layer.

### 31. **`ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)`**
    - A communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.

### 32. **`VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)`**
    - A subgroup within a network which can communicate as if they were directly connected, though they may be physically on different segments of the network.

### 33. **`MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)`**
    - A technique in telecommunications networks that directs data from one network node to the next based on short path labels rather than long network addresses.

### 34. **`SDN (Software Defined Networking)`**
    - An approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring.

### 35. **`Network Interface Card (NIC)`**
    - A hardware component that connects a computer to a network.

### 36. **`Gateway`**
    - A network node equipped for interfacing with another network that uses different protocols.

### 37. **`Proxy Server`**
    - A server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.

### 38. **`Load Balancer`**
    - A device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers.

### 39. **`IPv4 vs. IPv6`**
    - IPv4 and IPv6 are the fourth and sixth versions of the Internet Protocol. IPv6 was developed to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.

### 40. **`Subnetting`**
    - The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks. It is a primary method for segmenting a network and improving network security and performance.

### 41. **`Routing Protocol`**
    - A protocol that specifies how routers communicate with each other, disseminating information that enables them to select routes between any two nodes on a computer network.

### 42. **`Anycast`**
    - A network addressing and routing methodology in which incoming requests can be routed to a variety of different locations or "nodes."

### 43. **`Multicast`**
    - The delivery of information to a group of destinations simultaneously using the most efficient strategy to deliver the messages over each link of the network only once.

### 44. **`Unicast`**
    - One-to-one communication between one sender and one receiver, typical on most Internet connections.

### 45. **`Peering`**
    - An arrangement, on the Internet, between two or more networks to exchange traffic between their users directly, without charging one another.

### 46. **`Traceroute`**
    - A network diagnostic tool used for tracking the pathway data takes from one computer to another.

### 47. **`Netmask`**
    - A 32-bit mask used to divide an IP address into subnets and specify the network's available hosts.

### 48. **`SSID (Service Set Identifier)`**
    - The name of a wireless network, used to identify the network.

### 49. **`Firewall`**
    - A part of a computer system or network that is designed to block unauthorized access while permitting outward communication.

### 50. **`Cybersecurity`**
    - The practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information.
